### Hi! i'm TsukiGva2 ✌️
i'm a C programmer, currently focused in Operating Systems and Programming Langugage development.
You can check this page often for updates on my future projects (if i'm not insane by then).

Feel free to take a look around, at the moment You'll
mostly find projects experimenting with graphics,
programming languages and game development.

I also like writing toy programming
languages and actively browse [r/ProgrammingLanguages](https://reddit.com/r/ProgrammingLanguages/s/y9M0xSBdiL)

### (I'm also an OpenBSD fan!)
I seriously plan on participating on the development, but
i surely lack the discipline and general systems programming
knowledge and understanding at the moment. But i'm improving!

### Misc.
